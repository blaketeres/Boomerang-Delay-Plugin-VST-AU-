### What is this repository for? ###

* A simple delay plugin that offers millisecond and DAW bpm sync.
* Still has some bugs, should be fixed soon.

### Known issues ###

* Sync option not working in some DAWs (hardcoded to 120 BPM for now)
* Upon closing the plugin window, parameters reset.
* Modulation effect sounds bad (for now!)
* Please note that this was a class project, and it is not meant to be used for professional use. It has bugs and problems that make it unreliable.
